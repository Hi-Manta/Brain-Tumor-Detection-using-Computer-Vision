## 🧠 Tumor Types

| Tumor Type   | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| **Glioma** | Tumor from glial cells, can be low or high grade |
| **Meningioma** | Arises from the meninges (usually benign) |
| **Pituitary** | Forms in the pituitary gland, affects hormone balance |
| **General Tumor** | Any non-specified tumor in the brain area |

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## 🧰 Deployment Tips for Streamlit Cloud
If deploying on Streamlit Cloud, make sure your requirements.txt includes:
```bash
streamlit
ultralytics
opencv-python-headless
Pillow
numpy
```
⚠️ Avoid using opencv-python on Streamlit Cloud, as it may cause libGL.so.1 errors.
